# Kres - Android

With this application, the goal is to ensure that individuals such as the principal, teacher, cook, nurse, service driver, parent and child in the kindergarten interact. The processes necessary to ensure this interaction are designed in a modular structure. In general, these modules are; person registration, survey, course schedule, disease and medicine information, activity sharing, meal schedule, e-scorecard, sleep tracking, service tracking, student tracking, messaging.

All transactions made in the application work in constant communication with the database. For this, the application is designed to remain completely connected to the Internet.

After choosing the school, it is used by logging in with the previously created user name and password.

It is developed to be accessible from Android, iOS and website.

The application is under development.
